# Understanding and Explaining The Project With Copilot

- **The Basics:**
  - The application seems to be a web page, given the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.
  - HTML (`index.html`) is likely setting up the structure of the page, like the skeleton of a body.
  - CSS ([`style.css`](command:_github.copilot.openRelativePath?%5B%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2Fworkspaces%2Fwebdev-with-copilot%2Ftranscripts%2F03-css-dev%2Fsolution%2Fstyle.css%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%5D "/workspaces/webdev-with-copilot/transcripts/03-css-dev/solution/style.css"), the part you showed) is making the page look nice, like choosing the outfit for the skeleton.
  - JavaScript (`script.js`) probably adds interactivity, like making the skeleton dance when you click a button.
  - 
- **Functionality Guess:**
  - Given the names, this app might let users interact with plants in some way, maybe placing them in containers or something similar.
  - The JavaScript file is likely used to handle these interactions, like dragging a plant image into a container.

- **Learning Points:**
  - How HTML, CSS, and JavaScript work together to build a web page.
  - The use of CSS for styling and layout, including positioning elements on the page.
  - The concept of responsiveness and interactivity added by JavaScript.
